    "bookname": "Diplomacy",
    "author": "Henry Kissinger",
    "quote": "Statesmen, even warriors, focus on the world in which they live; to prophets, the real world is the one they want to bring into being",
    "analysis": "Teddy Roosevelt, the statesmen, justified American intervention by practical realities: excersise power in the nation's best interest. Woodrow Wilson, the prophet, justified intervention with moral principles: excersize power to uphold American ideals. Both idealistic and realistic diplomacy have their merits, and as with most problems, the best solution is somewhere in the middle. Roosevelt is still my favorite president though.",

    "author": "Antoine de Saint-Expury",
    "quote": '"We do not record flowers," said the geographer. "Why is that? The flower is the most beautiful thing on my planet!". "We do not record them, " said the geographer, "because they are ephermeral."',
    "analysis": "The geographer is not concerned with the rose because he is only concerned of 'matters of consequence' - things that are pragmatic. The Little Prince loves the rose because he thinks its beautiful, not because it serves a purpose. We should love things not because they serve a purpose, but because we love it; don't be too realistic. My favorite quote of all time, 'L'art pour l'art' (art for art's sake), is the same idea: do things for their own sake",

    "bookname": "The Unbearable Lightness of Being",
    "author": "Milan Kundera",
    "quote": "But because they deal with something that will not return, the bloody years of the revolution have turned into mere words, theories, and discussions, have become lighter than feathers, frightening no one",
    "analysis": "Honestly this book was so weird, but this quote was really important. The idea of eternal-return is that any event, like mistakes throughout history, will happen again and again if not acknowledged. The lesson is to take special attention to mistakes, because they repeat themselves if not corrected.",

    "author": "Dwight Moody",
    "quote": "So all that the old dukes had been without knowing it, this duke would fain know he was without being it.",
    "analysis": "The old dukes had respect, power, and leadership without constantly projecting it. The new dukes act like they have respect, power, and leadership for everyone to see, but they don't actually have it. Be like the old dukes: try to actually be great instead of trying to seem like it."

    "bookname": "The Old Man and the Sea",
    "author": "Ernest Hemingway",
    "quote": '"Why was I not born with two good hands? he thought. Perhaps it was my fault for not training that one properly. But God knows he had enough chances to learn.',
    "analysis": "The Old Man complains that his left arm is weak, and it let him down when trying to catch the fish. But he knew that he was given enough chances to train and still didn't. Try and fix your weaknesses as soon as they become apparent so it doesn't let you down when you need it. Regret sucks because it was in your control."
