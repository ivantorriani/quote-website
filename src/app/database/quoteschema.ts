    "quote": "Statesmen, even warriors, focus on the world in which they live; to prophets, the real world is the one they want to bring into being",
    "analysis": "Teddy Roosevelt, the statesmen, justified American intervention by practical realities: excersise power in the nation's best interest. Woodrow Wilson, the prophet, justified intervention with moral principles: excersize power to uphold American ideals. Both idealistic and realistic diplomacy have their merits, and as with most problems, the best solution is somewhere in the middle. Roosevelt is still my favorite president though.",

    "quote": '"We do not record flowers," said the geographer. "Why is that? The flower is the most beautiful thing on my planet!". "We do not record them, " said the geographer, "because they are ephermeral."',
    "analysis": "The geographer is not concerned with the rose because he is only concerned of 'matters of consequence' - things that are pragmatic. The Little Prince loves the rose because he thinks its beautiful, not because it serves a purpose. We should love things not because they serve a purpose, but because we love it; don't be too realistic. My favorite quote of all time, 'L'art pour l'art' (art for art's sake), is the same idea: do things for their own sake",
